    description: |-2
        * This project aims to explain both the new W mass reported by Fermi Lab and the long existed discrepancy of forward-backward asymmetry by introducing new vector-like quarks
        * Considering the oblique correction and then did the global fitting to find the reasonable mass of the new particles
  - title: Probing BSM effects with machine learning

      description: |-2
          * This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to the phenomenological analyses of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), with a focus on the measurements at future lepton colliders.
          * With simulations of e+e-â†’WW from MadGraph5, using machine learning to find the likelihood ratio in terms of the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators in this process
          * Future plans involve the applications of these methods to other processes, such as top-pair productions.

      description: |-2
          * This project aims to find the parameters that determine the time of the sinking of a bowl with a hole in its base.
          * Build the experimental device and simulating the process of sinking by COMSOL.
          * The results are obtained by using the Bernoulli equation with losses and solving the differentia equations using numerical simulation by Mathematica.
