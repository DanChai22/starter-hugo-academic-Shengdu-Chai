        * Explained both the new W boson mass $m_W^{\rm CDF-II}$ reported by Fermi Lab and the long existed discrepancy of forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}^{0,b}$ by introducing new vector-like quarks
        * Explored the model properties by performing a global electroweak fit. Found that the model is consistent with the current direct-search limits at the LHC, the HL-LHC, can cover most of the regions of the parameter space preferred by the electroweak fit. Determined that the one-loop contribution to Higgs couplings in this model was also relevant, which is consistent on current measurement and may be excluded on future collider
        * Determined that the mass of the exotic quark (with charge $-4/3$) is required to be below 4 TeV at the 95\% confidence level, and the best-fit point corresponded to a mass of around 1.5 TeV

    description: |-2
        * Aimed to apply machine learning techniques to the phenomenological analyses of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), focusing on the measurements at future lepton colliders
        * Performed machine learning methods with simulations of $e^{+}e^{-} \to W^{+} W^{-} $, including some systematic effects to determine the likelihood ratio in terms of the Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators in this process. 
        * Determined that the machine learning method performed better than the traditional methods, such as Optimal Observable, which corrected the large bias of model parameters and gave strong constraints
        * Planned to explore the applications of these methods to other processes, such as top-pair productions, and using the more realistic datasets from colliders
  - title: Nonlinear Differential Equations and Chaos

    description: |-2
        * Elucidated the relationship between nonlinear differential equations and chaos and found a way to describe quantum chaos
        * Simulated the Chuaâ€™s Circuit by Mathematica to generalize the characteristic of Nonlinear Differential Equations and Classical Chaos
        * Calculated the Spectral Form Factor of the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), one of the ensembles of Random Matrix Theory (RMT), which can be a signature of Quantum Chaos

        * Aimed to find the parameters that determined the time of the sinking of a bowl with a hole in its base
        * Built the experimental device and simulated the sinking process via COMSOL
        * Obtained results via using the Bernoulli equation with losses and solved the differential equations using numerical simulation by Mathematica
