title: A New Look in the Beautiful Mirror from the W-boson Mass Measurement
summary: Apply machine learning techniques to the phenomenological analyses of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), with a focus on the measurements at future lepton colliders. A typical process of $e^{+}e^{-} \to W^{+}W^{-}$ was studied.
